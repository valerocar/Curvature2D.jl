This interactive application (based on Dash for Julia) demonstrates how to construct
a curve with a given curvature function.
For a point $p$ in a planar curve the curvature $\kappa(p)$ measures its deviation from being a straight line at $p$.
For a straight line $\kappa = 0$ and for a circle of radius $r$ we have
$\kappa=1/r$ . For an arbitrary curve $\kappa(p)=1/r(p)$ where $r(p)$ is the radius of the circle that best approximates the curve at $p$ (this circle is known as the _osculating circle_).
